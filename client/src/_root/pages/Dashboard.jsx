// Things to do:
// Data Summary Cards: At the top of the content area, it would be helpful to have small cards or widgets that summarize key data points,
//  like the total number of tasks, tasks completed, overdue tasks, and tasks in progress.

// Filter Options: Above or beside the chart, you might add dropdown menus or buttons to filter the tasks by date range,
//  category, priority, or status, which would dynamically update the chart.

// Recent Activity Feed: A section that lists recent updates or changes to tasks,
//  providing a quick overview of the latest activity within the projects or tasks.

// Task List: While the chart gives a visual summary, having a list view of tasks with the ability to sort and perhaps quick actions like edit
//  or mark complete could be very useful.

// Quick Add Task Button: A prominently placed button that allows users to quickly add a new task without navigating away from the dashboard.

// Notifications/Alerts Section: An area to display alerts for deadlines approaching, messages from team members, or system notifications.

// To-Do List or Upcoming Tasks: A dedicated section for upcoming tasks with due dates to keep the user informed on whatâ€™s next.

// Performance Metrics: If applicable, graphs showing performance over time, like average completion time for tasks, could provide insightful data.

// Customization Options: Allow users to personalize their dashboard view, like changing themes or deciding which widgets to display.

// Help/Resources: Links to documentation, tutorials, or support for users who need assistance navigating the dashboard or understanding how
//  to complete tasks.
